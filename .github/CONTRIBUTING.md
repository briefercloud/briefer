## :computer: Running Briefer in development mode

You need to be able to run Briefer in development mode to contribute to the project and test changes.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're looking to deploy Briefer, you can check our [deployment guide here](./DEPLOYMENT.md). This guide is focused on running Briefer in _development_ mode.

Below are the steps to run Briefer in development mode.

<br />

### 1. Install native dependencies

Briefer runs on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), so you'll need to have it installed on your machine. If you don't have it yet, you can download it [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

Briefer also uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), so make sure you have it too. In more recent versions of Docker, Compose is already included.

Besides that, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (we currently use Node v18) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your machine. You can download them [here](https://nodejs.org/) and [here](https://yarnpkg.com/), respectively.

<br />

### 2. Start the database, jupyter instance, and demo database

After installing the dependencies, you'll have to run the database, Jupyter instance, and demo database to which Briefer will connect.

To do that, run the following command in the root folder of the project:

```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

This command will create the necessary `.env` files and run the `docker-compose.dev.yaml` file.

<br />

### 3. Install Briefer's dependencies and start it

Finally, you'll need to install Briefer's dependencies and start the project.

To do that, run the following commands in the root folder of the project:

```bash
yarn install
```

After installing the dependencies, you can start Briefer by running:

```bash
yarn dev
```

<br />

### 4. (Optional) Running the AI service

Briefer's AI service is a separate service that generates code for the AI features, like _"Edit with AI"_ and _"Fix with AI"_. You don't necessarily need to run it, unless you're working on these features or want to use them.

To run it, you'll need to have [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/) installed on your machine.

After installing Python, we recommend creating a virtual environment to install the dependencies of the AI service.

```bash
cd ai
virtualenv venv
```

After creating the virtual environment, you can activate it by running:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, you can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
# you may need to `brew install mysql pkg-config` before
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, you can start the AI service by running:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

<br />

#### Troubleshoting

Here are a few things to try if you have trouble running Briefer in development mode.

1. Ensure you're running the latest version of Docker and Docker Compose.
2. Double-check that you have Node.js and Yarn installed, and make sure that you're using Node v18.
3. Reinstall the dependencies by removing the `node_modules` folder and running `yarn install` again. Please ensure that you're running Node v18 during the installation.
4. If you're having trouble running the AI service, ensure that you have Python 3.9 installed and that you've created a virtual environment for it. Also, make sure that you've installed the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. If you can't find the necessary `.env` files within each app's folder, try running `./start-dev.sh` again.
6. In case the applications complain about missing environment variables, you can always delete the `.env` files and run `./start-dev.sh` again to recreate them.

If you still can't run Briefer properly after following these instructions, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/briefercloud/briefer/issues).
