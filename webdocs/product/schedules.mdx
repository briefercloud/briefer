Briefer allows you to schedule your pages to run and update periodically. This feature is useful when you want to keep your data and dashboards up-to-date, run reports at specific times, or automate tasks.

To create a schedule, click on the three dots menu on the top right corner of the editor and select "Schedule". This will open the schedules panel, where you can configure the schedule's frequency, start date, and end date.

<Warning>You can only schedule pages that have been published. If you haven't published your page yet, you'll need to publish it before you can schedule it. Then, when the schedule runs, it will run the published version of the page.</Warning>

When configuring a schedule, you can set the following options:

- When the schedule should start running.
- Whether you want to receive notifications when the schedule succeeds or fails.

## Configuring schedule notifications

You can configure notifications for when your schedule succeeds or fails. To do this, click on the "Add" button next to the "Notifications" section when configuring your schedule.

<Note>Notifications are only available in Briefer's paid plans.</Note>

Then, select the type of notification you want to receive: email or Slack. If you choose email, you'll need to provide the email addresses of the recipients.

If you choose Slack, you must make sure to have a Slack integration set up in your workspace. Then, you can select the Slack channel where you want to receive the notifications. For more information on setting up Slack integrations, check out the [Slack integration](./product/slack-integration) page.
