description: 'Deploy Briefer for your whole team to use.'

**Briefer is a web application designed for multiple people to use**.

Ideally, you should deploy it to a server that is accessible to all the people who will view and create reports and dashboards, like an EC2 instance on AWS, a droplet on DigitalOcean, or a virtual machine on Azure. If you have a Kubernetes cluster, you can use that too.
